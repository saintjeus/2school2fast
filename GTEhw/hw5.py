#Question 1
# Given a list of potentially duplicate integers return a list of distinct integers sorted by their frequency in the original list.
# Any numbers that had the same number of duplicates should be returned in their natural sort order. Note that the input data is not sorted.
# Also, remember to take advantage of Python constructs like the sorted function.
# Ex:
# [] => []
# [2] => [2]
# [2, 2, 2, 2] => [2]
# [3, 3, 2, 2] => [2, 3]
# [3, 3, 2, 2, 3] => [3, 2]
# [-1, -3, 0, -3, 5, 5, 5] => [5, -3, -1, 0]
